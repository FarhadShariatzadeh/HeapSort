Name : Sima Sheibani, spending time for assignment: 22 hours

It was pretty hard!! Very difficult to troubleshooting. 
It took a while to learn how to work with void* and compare!!

The best part of assignment: when I saw the sorted array :) 
Andy helped me a lot during his office hours. 
I used the sources which was provided in the instruction. They were helpfull.
